# TRACE
This project, developed for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon at Mar Athanasius College of Engineering (MACE), Kothamangalam, aims to revolutionize how we predict and manage satellite decay in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
Our tool estimates the lifetime and re-entry time of satellites using physics-based orbital models, empirical atmospheric data, and space-weather inputs — without relying on TLE data.

What It Does

Simulates orbital decay from 120–1000 km altitude.

Integrates realistic atmospheric density models (e.g., NRLMSISE-00).

Accounts for solar and geomagnetic activity effects (F10.7, Ap).

Allows customisation by satellite mass, area, and drag coefficient.

Provides clear lifetime estimates and decay visualisation.

Why It Matters

LEO is becoming increasingly crowded. Understanding how long satellites stay in orbit helps prevent space debris, improve mission design, and promote sustainable space operations.
This project empowers researchers and students to model orbital lifetimes more accurately, inspiring innovation in space sustainability.
